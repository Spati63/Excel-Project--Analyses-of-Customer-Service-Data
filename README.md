● Customer Sentiment Analysis:
From the achart we can observe Most customers are not very happy, with a lot giving "Negative" feedback (17,089 responses). Yet, there's a good chunk (7,098 responses) who are positive in the "Positive" and "Very Positive" categories. To make customers happier, it's important to fix the issues causing negative feelings while keeping up the good stuff.

● Root Cause Analysis:
With 23,462 calls, "Billing Question" is a major concern. To prevent future issues, it's vital to proactively address recurring problems related to billing and improve processes.

● Service Response Time Analysis:
Analyzing the response times for customer queries and support requests, it's notable that 20,625 fall within the Service Level Agreement (SLA), suggesting a generally efficient customer service team. However, attention may be needed for the 4,168 instances where responses were "Above SLA" to ensure timely resolutions and improve overall efficiency.

● Customer Segmentation:
By analyzing the chart, it's evident that customers in the "Negative" and "Very Negative" segments experience higher instances of "Above SLA" responses, suggesting potential dissatisfaction with service timelines. Addressing the specific needs and pain points of these segments is crucial. On the positive side, "Within SLA" dominates for "Positive" and "Very Positive" customers, showcasing good service efficiency. Tailoring communications and services based on these insights can enhance overall customer satisfaction and address individual segment requirements.

● Trends and Patterns Identification:
Call-Center: Represents 32.30% of interactions and has a corresponding customer satisfaction score of 32.71%.
Chatbot: Comprises 25.06% of interactions with a customer satisfaction score of 25.18%.
Email: Accounts for 22.68% of interactions, accompanied by a customer satisfaction score of 22.46%.
Web: Represents 19.96% of interactions, with a corresponding customer satisfaction score of 19.65%.

Analyzing these percentages can help identify trends and patterns. For instance, if one channel has a notably higher or lower satisfaction score compared to its interaction percentage, it might indicate a need for improvement or further investigation. This information can guide process improvements and innovative service offerings to enhance customer satisfaction across all channels.
